Analysis of a Space X Dataset

Space X is a private american aerospace manufacturer with the primary objective of making space travel far more accessible to the human race (SpaceX, 2021). Notably it's accomplishments include being the first private company to launch liquid propellant rockets and astronauts into orbit, as well as successfully reuse orbital rockets.

Among Space X's long list of accomplishments, arguably it's greatest achievement is it's ability to significantly reduce it's cost of operations through innovations in space travel. On a per seat cost basis, NASA's Apollo and space shuttle programs had costs of $390 million and $170 million respectively. Astoudningly Space X's Dragon capsule seats only cost $55 million (McCarthy, 2021). A major component of these savings are the result of reusing several aspects to each rocket.

This report will focus on the analysis of Space X's launch patterns, various financials and any correlations with Tesla. The focus on launch patterns will deliver insights into where Space X invests it's resources and how this aligns with their primary mission. A dive into the financials reveals one aspect of their reusability program and how it may impact the performance of the company. Finally Elon is considered an entrepreneur and many people believe in the 'man behind the mission'. This report attempts to explore this unique situtaion where both his companies, Space X and Telsa may have performance correlations due to public sentiment.
